# My goals for Youtube
- Learning
- Entertainment (high entertainment to time density)
- High quality content
    - Rationale for blocking shorts: they're usually not high quality and are pumped out quickly
- Stop aimless searching
    - Blur search entries except channel?
    - Filter by category
- Be in control of what, when, and how long I watch

# Subscription Criteria
(Doesn't need to meet all criteria, just most)
- Respects me as a viewer, that means no clickbait
- I will retain the information
- Important/relevant to me
- Will make me more aware in general
- Will always enthusiastically watch at regular speed


### Beware:
- Entertainment masquerading as education (eg. game dev channels)
- You can't learn something from a youtube video alone. Therefore, subscriptions with long videos are usually bad. Prefer theory/overview over implementation.

Start watching because they are "entertaining enough" but I always leave dissatisfied
